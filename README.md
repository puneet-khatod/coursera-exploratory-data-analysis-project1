Exploratory Data Analysis
=========================
As required by the "Exploratory Data Analysis" course of coursera, I have created this repository. 

Please follow below steps to run this:
* Download plot1.R, plot2.R, plot3.R, plot4.R to local directory;
* Download the data from: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip;
* Extract the data into ./Data subdirectory;
* Run the scripts
